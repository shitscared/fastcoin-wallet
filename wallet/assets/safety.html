		<p>Some words about safety of your Bitcoins:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Bitcoins in Bitcoin Wallet are stored on the device.
				<b>If you lose your device, you'll lose your Bitcoins.</b>
			</li>
			<li>
				This means you need to <b>back up your private keys</b>!
				Keep them at a safe place and remember your encryption password.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Before uninstalling Bitcoin Wallet</b> (or clearing app data/wiping your device), <b>transfer your Bitcoins to another wallet</b>.
				Remaining Bitcoins will be lost.
			</li> 
			<li>
				<b>Payments are irreversible</b>.
				If you send your Bitcoins into the void, there is no way to get them back unless you know the receiver and she is willing to send them back.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Keep your mobile device safe!</b>
				Do only install apps you fully trust.
				Malicious apps could be trying to steal your wallet.
			</li>
			<li>
				Keep the risk low!
				<b>Only use Bitcoin Wallet with small amounts</b> for day use.
			</li>
